I am a Japanese high school student.
I am Japanese, so I cannot write and speak English very well.

Coding is the one of my hobbies.
I write codes everyday to learn "C".So I will publish some of them.

If you need, you can use these programs without any permission.
But I cannot take any responsibility.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me the bad points and how to fix them.

It is the most important that I am flighty.
If I can continue this habit, God will have bressed me.

Thank you for reading.
